Python OOPs
readabiity to high extend
support number of library
To access Python Kernel, IDE required

Anaconda: entire suite of modules available

Anaconda Prompt > Navigate to set working directory
 	> deploy the IDE

*We see a browser based IDE with local files not part of IDE

Cell Type: Markdown call -> Text , non executable


Key board short cut:

Shift + Tab > description
Tab key / Help > different possible

Numpy: multi dimentional array handling
Scipy: statistical pkg
matplotlib: graph
pandas

Not readily available pkg: go to terminal in run, 
		eg: conda install plotly
		    if pkg is showing not available then go to anaconda to see the code to download that pkg
      		    using this plotly would get downloaded

Sub modules are downloaded with Modules


Python application beyond data science

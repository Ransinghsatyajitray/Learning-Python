Python OOPs
readabiity to high extend
support number of library
To access Python Kernel, IDE required

Anaconda: entire suite of modules available

Anaconda Prompt > Navigate to set working directory
 	> deploy the IDE

*We see a browser based IDE with local files not part of IDE

Cell Type: Markdown call -> Text , non executable


Key board short cut:

Shift + Tab > description
Tab key / Help > different possible

Numpy: multi dimentional array handling
Scipy: statistical pkg
matplotlib: graph
pandas

Not readily available pkg: go to terminal in run, 
		eg: conda install plotly
		    if pkg is showing not available then go to anaconda to see the code to download that pkg
      		    using this plotly would get downloaded
		    

Sub modules are downloaded with Modules


Python application beyond data science

Primary focus data analysis: python and R are alike
Object oriented programming: python better
if statistic not the only focus: python


Installation basic:
anaconda: entire suite of installer
Seeing the working directory:
%cd  or pwd (print working directory)


Setting new working directory:
In the anaconda command prompt: cd XXXXXXXXXXXXpath_of_the_working_directoryXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
then write: dir
then write: Jupyter notebook
then this code will run an the Jupyter note book will open/launch with the new path.


Q. Why are not all directory being provided by default in the directory list in the Jupyter notebook?
A. Its due to security reason.


See the description of functions: shift + tab

Autofill: tab

Installing new package: close the current prompt
Open new prompt: conda install XXXpackage_nameXXXXX
> if this fails then go to anaconda and check the command to install the same
installation syntax might change.
